This is a voting app I built that is inspired by this 
one (https://github.com/babsyinks/voting-app) I built 
for the school I graduated from.The aim is to make it 
available for use by anyone rather than only by the 
alumni of my school.This app is developed using 
React, Redux, Express, PostgresSql and Node.
The one I built for my school used MongoDB rather than
PostgresSql.
